Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engeneering is the systematic application of engeneering tools used for developing and maintaining software, it is important in the technology industry because it plays an impotant part by allowing the creation applications and systems that power the aspects of morden life these can include entertainment, healthcare and communication.
 
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
the development of programming languages 
mastering complexity 
mastering progress

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirements:gathering and indentifying user needs and system requirements 
design: creating detailed designs of the software architecture and user specifications 
implementaion:writing code and building the software according to design specifications 
testing: conducting tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
development: releasing the software to users
maintenance: providing enhancments and updates to the software after development 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodlogies: sequential approach with distinct phases 
- low flexibility
- changes are hard to inergrate once phase is complete
- late customer feedback once product is developed
- testing is done at the end of the dvelopment process
aglie metodologies: iterative and incremental approach with mutliple cycles
- high flexibilty
- adapts to chaging requirements
- there is regular customer feedback into evry sprint
- continuous testing is done after each iteration 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer responsibilities:
- writing code and implementing software solutions
- reporting to project mnager about progress of the software development
- maintaining software to keep it functional
- collaborating with team memebr to ensure best practice when developing software 
quality assurance engineer responsibilities:
- ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
- confirms that software meets requirements before deployment
- analyses product toidentify bugs and suggest chnages to make them more sufficient
- collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement
project magaer responsibilities:
- oversees planning, execution and delivery of software projects
- creates blueprint for the project
- discuss projects and requirements with client and software developers
- communicating information regarding the prohects milestone
- delivering the complete software to the client and checking its performance regularly 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE is a software suite that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, debu and test code and example of such is Eclipse
importance:
- IDE's make suggestions to complete a code statement when the dveloper begins typing
- they increase programmers productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change
- IDE allows developers to automate unit tests locally before the software is incorporated with other developers' code and more complex integration tests are run
VCS are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time; example:Git
importance:
- collaboration:Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts
- change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification
- error recovery: allows reverting to previous versions if theres any new chnages 


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
changing requirements: may change during development cycle
solution:adopting agile development which emphasizes iterative and adaptabilty enabling flexibility 
time contraints:pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed dvelopment 
solution: adopting agile methodlogies like scrum to streamline workflow by dividing large projects into managable sprints 
software security: this is a complex and challenging task
solution:reseach ways to defend against hacking, phising and third-party threats

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing: they are close to the source of an application consisting in testing individual methods and functions and components used by your software to ensure that each unit performs its intended function
intergration testin: testing interactions between different components, this helps to ensure that data flows smoothly and interfaces work as expected 
system testing: testing the entire spftware system as a whole helping to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements
acceptance testing: testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs -
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the process of crafting questions or stantements to get the best possible responses from AI models, it is important as it assists to avoid not getting confusing and vague answers it is also important as it can improve users expirience and increase flxibilty 
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Draw a picture of a car
Draw a portrait of a red car with a cycle carrier with no bicycle present with its hazards on next to a blue building with the sign supermarket in yellow 
Clarity: The improved prompt specifies what is being asked an image of a car
Specific Details: Describing the car's appearance (red, with cycle carrier , with hazards on ) and the setting (next to a blue building with ther sign "supermarket" on yellow) gives clear guidance on the image to be created.
Concise: The additional details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated, making it easier for the artist to understand exactly what is needed.
